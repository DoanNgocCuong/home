Based on my search, I've found that Cursor AI does indeed support MCP integration. Let me provide you with more specific information:

## Cursor AI and MCP Integration

Cursor has built-in support for the Model Context Protocol (MCP), allowing it to connect with external systems and data sources. According to the Cursor documentation:

> "MCP allows you to connect Cursor to external systems and data sources. This means you can integrate Cursor with your existing tools and infrastructure, instead of being limited to the capabilities built into Cursor itself." [Cursor Documentation](https://docs.cursor.com/context/model-context-protocol)

## MCP Servers Compatible with Cursor

From the search results, there appears to be a dedicated directory for MCP servers compatible with Cursor at [cursor.directory/mcp](https://cursor.directory/mcp).

Here are some MCP servers that are confirmed to work with Cursor:

1. **DBT MCP Server** - A server that wraps the dbt CLI tool, enabling AI coding agents to interact with dbt projects

2. **File System** - For securely accessing and manipulating files

3. **Git/GitHub/GitLab** - For version control operations

4. **Web Search and Web Fetch** - For retrieving information from the internet

5. **Database servers** - Such as PostgreSQL, MySQL, MongoDB, etc.

6. **Code execution environments** - For running and testing code

## Recent Updates

Cursor recently added more MCP support features:

- In version 0.49, Cursor added MCP image support, which suggests that MCP servers with image processing capabilities can now be used with Cursor [Cursor Forum](https://forum.cursor.com/t/cursor-v0-49-generated-rules-new-history-ui-code-review-ui-and-mcp-image-support/79954)

## How to Connect MCP to Cursor

To connect an MCP server to Cursor:

1. Install the MCP server you want to use
2. Configure Cursor to connect to the MCP server
3. Access the MCP server's capabilities through Cursor's interface

You can set up MCP connections in Cursor through its settings, similar to how you would configure them in Claude Desktop or other MCP clients.

For the most up-to-date and comprehensive list of compatible MCP servers, I recommend checking Cursor's official documentation and the Cursor directory website.
