In Hanoi Vietnam, there is a girl named Grace. She is nineteen years old
Grace buys a new bicycle. It is a beautiful blue bike. While riding down the road, Grace sees a small dog. 

The dog has brown fer? and is very cute. Grace calls out "Hello little dog". The dog looks at her and wag his tail. She asks "What is your name?" The dog continue to wag his tail and ignore her. 
She says 'I want to play with you. I will give you a cookie' The dog runs close to Grace and look at her and sit down. She gives the dog a cookie and says 'good dog. You are so smart'
She gives the dog a cookie and it happily eats it. The dog runs off to play with another dog. 
Grace stands up and smiling and says 'Such a cute dog, today is a fun day'

Grace get back a bike and ride home and still thinking about the cute dog. Today is a fun day.
