In this paper, we introduce PlugLM, a pre-training model with differentiable plug-in memory(DPM). The key intuition behind is to decouple the knowledge storage from model parameters with an editable and scalable key-value memory and leverage knowledge in an explainable manner by knowledge retrieval in the DPM. We conduct extensive experiments under various settings to justify this design choice. In domain adaptation setting, PlugLM could be easily adapted to different domains with plugable in-domain memory---obtaining 3.95 F1 improvements across four domains, without any in-domain training.

In this paper, we introduce PlugLM, a pre-training model with differentiable plug-in memory(DPM). The key intuition behind is to decouple the knowledge storage from model parameters with an editable and scalable key-value memory and leverage knowledge in an explainable manner by knowledge retrieval in the DPM. We conduct extensive experiments under various settings to justify this design choice. In domain adaptation setting, PlugLM could be easily adapted to different domains with plugable in-domain memory---obtaining 3.95 F1 improvements across four domains, without any in-domain training.

The key intuition behind is to decouple the knowledge storage from model parameters with an editable and scalable key-value memory and leverage knowledge in an explainable manner by knowledge retrieval in the DPM. We conduct extensive experiments under various settings to justify this design choice.
