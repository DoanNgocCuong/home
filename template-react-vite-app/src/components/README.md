# Components Folder

This folder contains **reusable UI components** like buttons, modals, inputs, etc.

âœ… **Best Practices:**

- Do **not** put page-specific components here.
- Keep each component in its own folder (e.g., `/Button/Button.jsx`).
- Use **CSS Modules or Styled Components** for styles.

ðŸ›‘ **Avoid placing layouts or pages here!**
