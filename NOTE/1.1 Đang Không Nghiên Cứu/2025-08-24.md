I have feels:

1. The deep lightness of life purposes: ending suffering.
- When sex arises, at first fog, but then it was uncomfortable.

2. Today, August 24, 2025 is a bit drowsy, I remember:
- The outstanding feeling of breathing, deep breathing
- The feeling of continuous attention from one object to another

- Actively fun and comfortable
- The light dopamine of difficulty instead of enjoying the strong dopamine of happiness.


Summary of Hormonal decoding books
-Dopamine suffering and pleasure from psychological perspective is similar to Buddhism https://youtu.be/KMWCXAIR-D4?feature=shared
--- This video is quite good, one of the rare videos about dopamine that true nature between material and mind. 
1. Pain (Pain) is different from suffering (Suffering) 
   - Very true to Gosinga, Theravada Buddhism: Pain (suffering) only accounts for 5% very small, 95% is miserable. 
2. Dopamine: Wanting, not Liking (desired hormone, not interested). 
- Very similar to Gosinga: Our desire is to end suffering, not the desire to feel, feel happy. 
- Suffering before happiness. Today: happy before suffering later. Too dependent on high dopamine activity: sex, or fast food, surfing the network 
=> making it difficult for us to feel normal such as walking, meditation, practice, ... 3. In the past, less miserable than now. 
- How to flee the usual pain: drugs, pornography, ... only change one suffering. - Acts of avoiding repeated pain, addiction and depending on the avoidance. 
+, Old days: Only watch movies at 9pm. Now the movie is continuous.
 === 
1. Self -binding: external forces and internal force (body mind).
- Throw your phone in the trash.
- Always go out on weekend and Sunday. T7 sat alone Kaizen. CN sitting with friends
2. Paying with pain:
- Jogging and continuously goes out of the circle. Every time I want to stop and scoop myself a little. Jogging stimulates moderately dopamine, affecting the mood, energy, sleep. 
- It goes against the sake of the pain. 
- Cold bath. Dopamine increases steadily when bathing cold water - taking advantage of pain can also be addicted. The price to pay when addicted to pain
3. Absolute honesty - are looking for discomfort - going against the fast dopamine:
- Acknowledging your own problems. To focus on handling it instead of justifying, and avoiding.
