What is Cluster Analysis?
■ Cluster: A collection of data objects
■ similar (or related) to one another within the same group
■ dissimilar (or unrelated) to the objects in other groups
■ Cluster analysis (or clustering, data segmentation, ...)
■ Finding similarities between data according to the
characteristics found in the data and grouping similar data
objects into clusters
■ Unsupervised learning: no predefined classes (i.e., learning by
observations vs. learning by examples: supervised)
■ Typical applications
■ As a stand-alone tool to get insight into data distribution
■ As a preprocessing step for other algorithms
