Based on all the information gathered, I can now provide you with a comprehensive answer about Supabase's current free tier storage limits.

# Supabase Free Tier Storage Limits in 2025

According to the latest information from Supabase's official website and documentation, the current storage limits for Supabase's free tier are:

## Database Storage
- **Database Size**: 500 MB included per project
- **Projects**: Limit of 2 active free tier projects per organization
- **Pausing**: Free projects are automatically paused after 1 week of inactivity
- **Behavior When Limit Exceeded**: When you exceed the 500MB limit, your project enters read-only mode

## Other Storage-Related Limits
- **File Storage**: 1 GB included
- **Bandwidth**: 5 GB included
- **Maximum File Upload Size**: 50 MB per file
- **Monthly Active Users (MAUs)**: 50,000 included

## Additional Free Tier Features
- **API Requests**: Unlimited
- **Concurrent Peak Connections**: 200 included
- **Edge Function Invocations**: 500,000 included
- **Messages Per Month**: 2 Million included

## When You Exceed the Free Tier Limits
If your database exceeds the 500MB size limit, your project will be put into read-only mode. In this state, you can still read data but cannot write to the database. You'll see errors like "cannot execute INSERT in a read-only transaction" when trying to write data.

You then have two options:
1. **Upgrade to the Pro Plan**: This increases your limit to 8GB database size (starting at $25/month)
2. **Reduce Your Database Size**: You can temporarily disable read-only mode, delete data, and run vacuum operations to reclaim space

## How to Check Your Current Database Size
You can check your current database size by running the following SQL query in Supabase's SQL Editor:
```sql
select
  sum(pg_database_size(pg_database.datname)) / (1024 * 1024) as db_size_mb
from pg_database;
```

This will show you the current size of your Postgres database in megabytes.

## Important Notes
- New Supabase projects start with approximately 40-60MB of preoccupied space due to pre-installed extensions, schemas, and default Postgres data
- Installing additional extensions will increase your database size even if they're inactive
- Deleting data doesn't immediately reduce database size until a vacuum operation is performed

If you need more storage, Supabase offers paid plans starting at $25/month for the Pro tier, which includes 8GB of database storage (expandable), 100GB of file storage, and many other increased limits.
