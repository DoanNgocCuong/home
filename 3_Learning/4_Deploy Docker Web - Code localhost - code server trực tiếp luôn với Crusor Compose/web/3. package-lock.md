Let me explain about `package-lock.json`:

**1. What is package-lock.json?**
- It's a file automatically generated by npm (Node Package Manager)
- It records the exact version of every package that your project depends on
- It includes all nested dependencies (dependencies of dependencies)
- It ensures that the same versions of packages are installed across different environments

**2. Should you delete package-lock.json?**
Generally, you should NOT delete `package-lock.json` because:

1. **Consistency**:
   - Without it, different developers might get different versions of packages
   - This can lead to "it works on my machine" problems
   - Your production environment might behave differently from development

2. **Security**:
   - It locks security fixes to specific versions
   - Prevents unexpected updates that might introduce bugs

3. **Build Reliability**:
   - Makes builds more predictable
   - Faster installations with `npm ci`
   - Better Docker caching

**3. When might people delete it?**
People sometimes delete it when:
1. They want to update all dependencies to their latest versions
2. They're having dependency conflicts
3. They're cleaning up their project

However, this is generally not recommended because:
- It can lead to inconsistent builds
- It might introduce unexpected bugs
- It makes the build process less reliable

**4. Better Alternatives to Deleting:**
Instead of deleting `package-lock.json`, you should:

1. Use `npm update` to update packages
2. Use `npm audit fix` to fix security issues
3. Use `npm install <package>@latest` to update specific packages
4. If you must regenerate it, use `npm install` to create a new one

**5. In Your Project:**
Looking at your project structure, `package-lock.json` is important because:
- You're using Docker for deployment
- You have a production environment
- You need consistent builds across different environments

The best practice is to:
1. Keep `package-lock.json` in version control
2. Don't delete it unless absolutely necessary
3. Use proper npm commands to manage dependencies
4. Let it be automatically updated when you make changes to `package.json`

Remember: `package-lock.json` is your friend for maintaining consistent and reliable builds, especially in a production environment.
