For quickly building a UI to complement your existing backend, there are several tools that can help speed up the process:

1. **Backendless**: This platform offers a **visual UI builder** that allows you to create responsive web and mobile apps without writing any code. It provides a drag-and-drop interface for components, with codeless logic blocks to implement complex functionality. It also seamlessly integrates with Backendless APIs for managing backend operations. Backendless supports both serverless and managed hosting options, making it versatile depending on your needs【9†source】【10†source】.

2. **FastUI**: This is a Python-based framework designed for backend developers who want to create UI without diving into frontend tech stacks. With **FastUI**, you can build UIs using Python, and it connects well with frameworks like FastAPI, allowing you to manage both frontend and backend with ease. It simplifies UI building through reusable components and does not require JavaScript, making it perfect for Python developers【6†source】.

3. **Mendix**: A low-code platform ideal for building both web and mobile applications. Mendix offers a **drag-and-drop builder** and a collaborative environment, making it easy to design and deploy UI quickly. It also supports cloud integrations, making it scalable for enterprise solutions【7†source】.

4. **Jet Admin**: Another no-code tool tailored for building admin panels, CRMs, and dashboards. It integrates with multiple data sources and APIs, and offers pre-built components to get your UI running in no time【8†source】.

These platforms will help you quickly prototype and build your frontend, depending on whether you want more flexibility (e.g., with **FastUI** for Python developers) or a fully visual approach like **Backendless** or **Mendix**.
