Memory

Short-term memory, or thread -scoped memory, can be recalled at any time from within a single conversational thread with a user. LangGraph manages short- term memory as a part of your agent's 51. State is persisted to a database using a checkpointer so the thread can be resumed at any time. Short-term memory updates when the graph is invoked or a step is completed, and the State is read at the start of each step.

Memory

LangGraph manages short-term memory as part of the agent's state, persisted via thread-scoped checkpoints. This state can normally include the conversation history along with other stateful data, such as uploaded files, retrieved documents, or generated artifacts. By storing these in the graph's state, the bot can access the full context for a given conversation while maintaining separation between different threads.

Memory

Long conversations pose a challenge to today's LLMs. The full history may not even fit inside an LLM's context window, resulting in an irrecoverable error. Even if your LLM technically supports the full context length, most LLMs still perform poorly over long contexts. They get "distracted" by stale or off-topic content, all while suffering from slower response times and higher costs.

Memory

Chat models accept context using messages, which include developer provided instructions (a system message) and user inputs (human messages). In chat applications, messages alternate between human inputs and model responses, resulting in a list of messages that grows longer over time. Because context windows are limited and token-rich message lists can be costly, many applications can benefit from using techniques to manually remove or forget stale information.

Memory

LangGraph stores long-term memories as JSON documents in a store ( 54). Each memory is organized under a custom `namespace` (similar to a folder) and a distinct `key` (like a filename). Namespaces often include user or org IDs or other labels that makes it easier to organize information. This structure enables hierarchical organization of memories. Cross-namespace searching is then supported through content filters. See the example below for an example.

Different applications require various types of memory. Although the analogy isn't perfect, examining human memory types can be insightful. Some research (e.g., the CoALA paper) have even mapped these human memory types to those used in AI agents.

Memory

Semantic memory, both in humans and AI agents, involves the retention of specific facts and concepts. In humans, it can include information learned in school and the understanding of concepts and their relationships. For AI agents, semantic memory is often used to personalize applications by remembering facts or concepts from past interactions.

Alternatively, memories can be a collection of documents that are continuously updated and extended over time. Each individual memory can be more narrowly scoped and easier to generate, which means that you're less likely to lose information over time. It's easier for an LLM to generate new objects for new information than reconcile new information with an existing profile. As a result, a document collection tends to lead to higher recall downstream.

However, this shifts some complexity memory updating. The model must now delete or update existing items in the list, which can be tricky. In addition, some models may default to over-inserting and others may default to over-updating. See the Trustcall package for one way to manage this and consider evaluation (e.g., with a tool like LangSmith) to help you tune the behavior.

this paradigm suffers from the long-context window limitation of LLM (Liu et¬†al., 2024 ). Memory-based approaches provide a solution by leveraging a memory to store user historical content. When a new user query comes, a retriever will first retrieve relevant user information from the memory to prompt LLM produce personalized responses (Dalvi et¬†al., 30; Madaan et¬†al., 2022 ; Lewis et¬†al., 32; Zhang et¬†al., 2023 ). Unfortunately, they are limited in capturing fine-grained information due to the nature of similarity comparison retrieval process (Zhang et¬†al., 33).

To enable generative agents, we describe an architecture that extends a large language model to store a complete record of the agent's experiences using natural language, synthesize those memories over time into higher-level reflections, and retrieve them dynamically to plan behavior. We instantiate generative agents to populate an interactive sandbox environment inspired by The Sims, where end users can interact with a small town of twenty five agents using natural language. In an evaluation, these generative agents produce believable individual and emergent social behaviors: for example, starting with

context learning to organize the user historical content as prompts, providing them to LLM so that personal information can be considered (Petrov and Macdonald, 2023 ; Kang et¬†al., 27; Liu et¬†al., 2023 ). However, this paradigm suffers from the long-context window limitation of LLM (Liu et¬†al., 29). Memory-based approaches provide a solution by leveraging a memory to store user historical content. When a new user query comes, a retriever will first retrieve relevant user information from the memory to prompt LLM produce personalized responses (Dalvi et¬†al., 2022 ; Madaan et¬†al., 31; Lewis et¬†al., 2020 ; Zhang et¬†al., 33).

Additionally, user historical content can be complex and noisy, posing difficulties for LLMs to focus on the most relevant information without a proper learnable process. To address this, recent studies have proposed parameterizing and projecting user historical content into a learnable representation space (Ning et¬†al., 34; Deng et¬†al., 2022 ; Zhong et¬†al., 36). Instead of using text to prompt LLMs, the learned user representations can be neglected in the LLM‚Äôs decoding process via cross-attention to enable personalized response generation.

So far, DNCs have been demonstrated to handle only relatively simple tasks, which can be solved using conventional programming. But DNCs don't need to be programmed for each problem, but can instead be trained. This attention span allows the user to feed complex data structures such as 54 sequentially, and recall them for later use. Furthermore, they can learn aspects of symbolic reasoning and apply it to working memory. The researchers who published the method see promise that DNCs can be trained to perform complex, structured tasks[ 1 ][ 2 ] and address big-data applications that require some sort of reasoning, such as generating video commentaries or semantic text

We conduct extensive experiments under various settings to justify this design choice.

[2308.15022] Recursively Summarizing Enables Long-Term Dialogue Memory in Large Language Models

long conversation, these chatbots fail to recall past information and tend to generate inconsistent responses. To address this, we propose to recursively generate summaries/ memory using large language models (LLMs) to enhance long- term memory ability. Specifically, our method first stimulates LLMs to memorize small dialogue contexts and then recursively produce new memory using previous memory and following contexts. Finally, the chatbot can easily generate a highly consistent response with the help of the latest memory. We evaluate our method on both open and closed LLMs, and the experiments on the widely-used public dataset show that our method can generate more consistent responses in a long-

We evaluate our method on both open and closed LLMs, and the experiments on the widely-used public dataset show that our method can generate more consistent responses in a long- context conversation. Also, we show that our strategy could nicely complement both long-context (e.g., 8K and 16K) and retrieval-enhanced LLMs, bringing further long-term dialogue performance. Notably, our method is a potential solution to enable the LLM to model the extremely long context. The code and scripts will be released later.

On Memory Construction and Retrieval for Personalized Conversational Agents

To deliver coherent and personalized experiences in long-term conversations, existing approaches typically perform retrieval augmented response generation by constructing memory banks from conversation history at either the turn-level, session-level, or through summarization techniques. In this paper, we present two key findings: (1) The granularity of memory unit matters: Turn-level, session-level, and summarization-based methods each exhibit limitations in both memory retrieval accuracy and the semantic quality of the retrieved content. (2) Prompt compression methods, such as LLMLingua-2, can effectively serve as a denoising mechanism, enhancing memory retrieval accuracy across different granularities.

Building on these insights, we propose SeCom, a method that constructs the memory bank at segment level by introducing a conversation Se gmentation model that partitions long-term conversations into topically coherent segments, while applying Com pression based denoising on memory units to enhance memory retrieval. Experimental results show that SeCom exhibits a significant performance advantage over baselines on long-term conversation benchmarks LOCOMO and Long-MT-Bench+. Additionally, the proposed conversation segmentation method demonstrates superior performance on dialogue segmentation datasets such as DialSeg711, TIAGE, and SuperDialSeg.

* Selective Forgetting: Drawing inspiration from the Ebbinghaus Forgetting Curve, MemoryBank ensures that not all stored memories remain equally strong. Over time, if a memory isn‚Äôt recalled or reinforced, its strength decays and it may eventually be pruned from active storage. This selective forgetting keeps the memory bank relevant and uncluttered. * Reinforcement of Key Memories: Conversely, memories that are frequently accessed are reinforced. Each time a memory is recalled, its ‚Äústrength‚Äù is boosted, ensuring that important details persist over longer periods ‚Äî mirroring how human memory works through repeated retrieval.
