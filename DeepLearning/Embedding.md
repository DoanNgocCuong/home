What are various searches in Vector Databases?  
  
Vector Databases support various search types, enabling efficient retrieval of similar vectors. Here are some common search types:  
  
1. Exact Search: Retrieve exact matches.  
  
2. Nearest Neighbor Search (k-NN): Find k most similar vectors.  
  
3. Range Search: Retrieve vectors within a specified distance.  
  
4. Radius Search: Retrieve vectors within a fixed radius.  
  
5. K-Means Search: Cluster vectors into k groups.  
  
6. Faiss Search (Facebook AI Similarity Search): Efficient similarity search.  
  
7. Approximate Nearest Neighbor Search (ANN): Fast, approximate k-NN.  
  
8. Reverse Nearest Neighbor Search (RNN): Find vectors with query as nearest neighbor.  
  
Some advanced search types:  
  
1. Semantic Search: Search by meaning, context, or embeddings.  
  
2. Facial Search: Search faces based on facial features.  
  
3. Image Search: Search images by visual features.  
  
4. Text Search: Search text by semantic meaning.  
  
Vector database indexing techniques:  
  
1. Hashing (Locality-Sensitive Hashing, LSH).  
  
2. Tree-based indexing (k-d trees, ball trees).  
  
3. Graph-based indexing.  
  
4. Quantization (Product Quantization, PQ).  
  
Popular vector database management systems:  
  
1. Elasticsearch.  
  
2. Amazon OpenSearch.  
  
3. Pinecone.  
  
4. Weaviate.  
  
5. Qdrant.  
  
6. Milvus.  
  
Vector databases have applications in:  
  
1. Computer Vision.  
  
2. Natural Language Processing.  
  
3. Recommendation Systems.  
  
4. Audio Processing.
