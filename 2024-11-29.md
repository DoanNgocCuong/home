      "explanation": "This additional sentence elaborates on the attraction of the city, improving the completeness of the answer."
    }
  ]
}
```

### Explanation:

- **Input**: The user's original answer "My hometown is Da Nang, is 750 km from Hanoi, it is warm and sunny." is grammatically incomplete and lacks detail.
- **Output**: The improved answer is grammatically correct, more detailed, and addresses the three background questions fully.

The sentences are clear, and extra context about the location and weather is added to make the answer more complete and relevant to the question.
