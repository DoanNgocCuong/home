RAPTOR: Recursive Abstractive Processing for Tree-Organized Retrieval

January 31, 2024 — RAPTOR is a novel approach that uses recursive summarization to index and retrieve text chunks at different levels of abstraction. It improves the performance of language models on complex question-answering tasks that involve long-range context and discourse structure.
